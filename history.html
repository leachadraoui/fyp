                    The prehistoric period of Byblos marks the earliest known human presence in the region, dating back
                    to the Neolithic
                    period. Archaeological excavations have revealed traces of early settlements, including rudimentary
                    stone structures,
                    pottery fragments, and tools made from flint and bone. These findings suggest that Byblos was one of
                    the oldest
                    continuously inhabited cities in the world...
                    <span class="more-text">
                        During this era, the inhabitants of Byblos engaged in basic agriculture, animal domestication,
                        and
                        fishing along the
                        Mediterranean coast. The fertile lands and proximity to the sea allowed for a stable food
                        supply,
                        leading to the growth
                        of small communities. Excavations have uncovered evidence of early trade, as Byblos established
                        connections with
                        neighboring regions, exchanging resources such as obsidian, shells, and animal hides.

                        By the Chalcolithic period (Copper Age), advancements in metallurgy began appearing, with
                        primitive
                        copper tools and
                        ornaments emerging in archaeological layers. This period set the foundation for Byblos' later
                        development as a key
                        trading hub. Religious practices also began to take form, with the discovery of small figurines
                        and
                        burial sites
                        indicating early forms of spirituality and social organization.

                        By the end of the prehistoric age (around 3200 B.C.), Byblos had grown into a more structured
                        settlement, paving the way
                        for its rise as a significant center of trade and culture in the Eastern Mediterranean.

                <p>Byblos reached a decisive turning point in its evolution during the Early Bronze Age. The urban
                    structure that characterized it until the Middle Bronze Age was set: a central quarter, main temples
                    set around a central water spot, radiating ways, two southern and eastern residential quarters, wide
                    and spaced-out constructions to the west, and the appearance of the first ramparts. These were the
                    components of a city-state gathered around an urban and religious center and ruled by a local
                    dynasty.
                    <span class="more-text">
                        These rapid changes are mainly attributed to the privileged relations established with
                        Egypt since the fourth millennium. These contacts were intensified in the third millennium, with
                        royal alabaster and golden gifts, inscribed on pharaonic cartouches, found in the temples of
                        Byblos.

                        Besides the traditional Mediterranean products such as wine and oil, trade with Egypt was mainly
                        based on cedar wood. Thanks to the forestry resources of the Lebanese mountains, Byblos ensured
                        for
                        nearly two millennia a preponderant place in the trade between Egypt and the Near East. A
                        regional
                        revolving point, Byblos imported its jewelry from Mesopotamia, its metals from Anatolia, its
                        linen,
                        wheat, and papyrus rolls from the valley of the Nile, and its gold from Nubia.

                        At the end of the third millennium, Egypt entered a phase of recession mainly caused by
                        struggles
                        over power and broke its contacts with the Levant. A period of insecurity set in, attested by
                        the
                        destruction of Byblos caused by fire. As a result, the ramparts and the main monuments of the
                        city
                        underwent a long period of reconstruction.

                <p>The Iron Age in Lebanon witnessed the birth, the peak, and the expansion of the Phoenician culture.
                    The main information about the city of Byblos during this period is found in epigraphic sources,
                    especially in the Assyrian kings' annals and in the royal inscriptions found on the site. The
                    Phoenician levels of Byblos have not been found; they were probably buried or destroyed by later
                    structures. Only a few remains were discovered: a glacis, a guard tower, and the royal tomb where
                    the sarcophagus of King Ahiram (10th century B.C.) was found.
                    <span class="more-text">
                        The Iron Age witnessed a major event: the destructive invasion of the "Sea People", which made
                        Egypt
                        lose its control over the Levant. The independent Phoenician cities, including Byblos, took
                        advantage of this political change. Egyptian political decline is clear in the narrative of
                        Wen-Amun, the Egyptian emissary who came to Byblos around 1100 B.C. to obtain cedar wood for the
                        construction of the ceremonial boat of Amun, the great Egyptian god. Zakarbaal, prince of
                        Byblos,
                        received him coldly and insisted on the independence of the city.

                        However, this independence came to an end with the incursions of the Assyrian and Babylonian
                        kings
                        in the region. Since 1100 B.C., Byblos, Sidon, and Arados were paying tribute to King
                        Tiglath-Pileser I, consisting mainly of cedar wood. These military pressures did not prevent the
                        Phoenicians from setting out for the conquest of the Mediterranean. However, Byblos did not seem
                        to
                        have participated in this large expansion. It did not have any known trading posts or colonies,
                        unlike Beirut, Tyre, and Sidon. Nevertheless, it remained a very prosperous center of trade,
                        mainly
                        revolving around the timber wood industry. Its craftsmen enjoyed a great reputation in Babylon
                        at
                        the end of the 7th century B.C.

                <p>After his victory at the Battle of Issos in 333 B.C., Alexander the Great set off to conquer
                    Phoenicia. As the Macedonian King approached the coast, Byblos surrendered without resistance and
                    put its fleet at his disposal. At Alexander's death, Phoenicia became a battleground between his
                    successors, the Ptolemies and the Seleucids. The latter became the masters of Phoenicia in 198 B.C.
                    Nevertheless, at that time in Byblos, a tyrant called Kinyras seized power and spread terror.

                    Despite all these tribulations, Phoenicia enjoyed a privileged status in the organization set up by
                    Alexander and his successors.
                    <span class="more-text">
                        Though not the brilliant and wealthy city it had been in the second
                        millennium B.C., Byblos retained some of its economic, cultural, and religious prestige. This is
                        evidenced by the coinage of the reign of Antiochus IV (175-164 B.C.), which shows the religious
                        supremacy of the city, called "Gebal the Sacred". The dense network of houses and the industrial
                        area found on the site prove the prosperity of the city during that period. A textile industry
                        as
                        well as important weaving activity also flourished.

                        Our main sources for this period are literary. Classical texts reveal that Byblos possessed
                        wooded
                        territories outside its ramparts, so it still was an important center of wood export and
                        shipbuilding.

                        Because of the lack of systematic excavations, the development of coastal cities during this
                        period
                        is still largely unknown. However, epigraphic material reveals the existence of temples,
                        gymnasia,
                        and hippodromes. An inscription from Byblos mentions Dionysodoros and his son Aspasios, who were
                        gymnasiarchos (directors of the gymnasium). Also, a certain Timocrates participated in the
                        athletic
                        contests held in Greece.

                <p>In the first century B.C., the Roman general Pompey brought Phoenicia, which had been disrupted by
                    internal wars, to peace. However, it was not until Emperor Augustus’s reign (27 B.C.–14 A.D.) that
                    Roman peace was proclaimed and order restored. Byblos flourished under his reign, as attested by the
                    magnificence of public buildings and by the numerous monetary mints displaying Augustus’ head on the
                    reverse. Following this expansion, the provincial city started to develop and witnessed an urban
                    reorganization, thanks mainly to donations from Herod the Great. The prestige of Byblos as a
                    pilgrimage city is primarily due to its numerous cult places, in particular, the sanctuary of
                    Adonis, which is located in its territory.
                    <span class="more-text">
                        Under Roman occupation, the Hellenistic culture was still prevailing in Byblos and the region.
                        Numerous Greek inscriptions were uncovered, and outstanding philosophers such as Aurelius and
                        Aspasios emerged. The historian and grammarian Philo of Byblos asserts in his work about the
                        Gods of
                        Phoenicia that Byblos is one of the oldest cities in the world.

                        Several Roman texts praise the benefits of local wine, Biblinos oinos, which was compared with
                        the
                        wine of Lesbos by Athenaios of Naukratis in the second century A.D. Known for its papyrus trade
                        and
                        wine export, Byblos became, during the Roman period, one of the linen commercial centers. Under
                        the
                        reign of Emperor Hadrian (117-135 A.D.), the forests of Byblos' territory belonged to the
                        imperial
                        domain and were carefully regulated by inscriptions limiting forestry exploitation. Four tree

                        port of Byblos served all the naval building sites of the region and the empire's construction
                        projects.

                        The Roman Levant converted to Christianity around the middle of the 4th century A.D., with the
                        conversion of Emperor Constantine to the new religion. In the Byzantine period, Byblos, seat of
                        a
                        bishopric, belonged to the province of Marine Phoenicia, which witnessed an era of unity and
                        prosperity. Numerous remains were uncovered by excavators and completed by accidental findings.
                        The
                        only visible remains today are the residential quarter in the northeastern sector of the site
                        and a
                        church in the old city, the current "Our Lady of Deliverance".

                <p>During the early centuries of the Arab conquest, Jbeil was attached to the juridical district (jund)
                    of Damascus. There are no remaining traces in Byblos of the Umayyad and Abbasid periods, which were
                    periods of splendor in the history of the Levant. In the eleventh century, the Fatimid dynasty of
                    Egypt extended its rule towards the Levantine coast, which fell in 1095 under the direct control of
                    the Banu ‘Ammar emirs, a pro-Fatimid dynasty.

                    In 1104, Byblos was taken by Count Raymond de Saint Gilles and became a feudal property administered
                    by a Genoese family, the Embriaci, known as the "Lords of Gibelet". The Crusaders’ domination
                    continued until 1187, when Saladin was victorious over Guy de Lusignan, King of Jerusalem. Jbeil
                    then passed to the Ayyubid dynasty for a short period before it was once again captured by the
                    Franks.
                    <span class="more-text">
                        During this period, two earthquakes devastated Jbeil, causing severe damage and the collapse
                        of parts of the castle.

                        The thirteenth century was marked by incessant struggles between the members of the Embriaci
                        family
                        and their sovereign lords, the Bohemonds. As a result, Jbeil suffered and lost its importance.
                        In
                        1266, the Mamluk Sultan Baybars captured the city. He restored its fortifications and ultimately
                        attached it to the district of Beirut.

                        Towards the end of the fifteenth century, a local family, the Banu Hamada, governed Jbeil until
                        the
                        Ottoman arrival.
